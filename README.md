# 🤖 AI Code Review Assistant

An AI-powered web application that helps developers improve their code by providing intelligent code reviews, static analysis, and complexity metrics. The application allows users to upload or paste source code, receive AI-generated suggestions, and keep a history of previous reviews in a clean and user-friendly interface.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Writing clean and efficient code is an important part of software development, but manually reviewing code can be time-consuming. This project simplifies the process by combining Google's Gemini AI with static code analysis to provide instant feedback on submitted code.

The application also includes secure user authentication, review history, complexity analysis, and an attractive dashboard to enhance the user experience.
